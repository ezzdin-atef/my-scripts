# My Scripts

This Repo conatians all my personal and daily used scripts ‚ù§

## How to start using one of the bash scripts?

1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone URL
```

2. Go to the bash scripts directory

```bash
cd bash
```

3. Give the script executable permission

```bash
chmod +x script_name.sh
```

4. Run the script

```bash
./script_name.sh
```

To Add the script to your PATH, you can do the following:

1. Go to your home directory

```bash
cd ~
```

2. Open the .zshrc file (assuming you are using zsh)

```bash
nano .zshrc
```

3. Add the following line to the file

```bash
alias alias_name="~/PATH/TO/SCRIPT/script_name.sh"
```
